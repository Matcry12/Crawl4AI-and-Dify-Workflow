To initiate a new EOS Network project locally for contract and frontend development, utilize the `npm create vaulta@latest myproject` command, which is essential for developers transitioning from the Web IDE to a full local development workflow. This command streamlines the setup process by prompting you to configure your project, offering the choice between a pre-built template or a barebones structure. The barebones option provides a solid foundation, including a simple smart contract, comprehensive tests, deployment scripts, and the flexibility to select a preferred frontend framework such as SvelteKit, Next.js, or Nuxt. This effectively establishes a foundational project environment ready for immediate development.
