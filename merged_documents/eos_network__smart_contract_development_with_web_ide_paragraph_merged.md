Begin your EOS Network smart contract development journey by leveraging the Web IDE, an ideal browser-based platform for immediate prototyping and testing of your smart contract logic, enabling rapid experimentation and iteration on ideas before committing to a local development environment. This tool allows for quick coding and immediate interaction with the blockchain, empowering developers to understand contract behavior and iterate on logic without the overhead of local environment configuration, making it the recommended first step for new developers to gain hands-on experience. For those ready to set up projects locally, the EOS Network provides a convenient CLI command that scaffolds new projects, including essential frontend and contract structures, with support for popular frameworks like SvelteKit, Next.js, and Nuxt.
