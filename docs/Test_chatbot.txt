Q: What is smart contract event? explain all|
A: Based on the provided documents, here is a comprehensive explanation of smart contract events.

### Events Overview

A smart contract event is a mechanism that allows smart contracts to communicate with each other. This communication occurs as a "side-effect" of actions being executed. While events can be used for any type of inter-contract communication, their most common application is for tracking transfers, specifically `core.vaulta` (`A`) transfers.

The concept of "Events" is a fundamental topic in EOS smart contract development, listed alongside other core components such as Actions, State Data, and Authorization in the official documentation.

### The Two Sides of an Event

Every event involves two distinct parties:

1.  **The Sender:** This is a `contract::action` that is responsible for "emitting" the event.
2.  **The Receiver:** This is another contract that is "listening" for that specific event.

### The Event Receiver

The receiving side of an event has unique characteristics that distinguish it from a standard contract action.

*   **Nature:** An Event Receiver is a **function**, not an action.
*   **Trigger Mechanism:** This function is automatically called when another contract's action explicitly "tags" the receiver's contract as a recipient.

#### Implementation Example

The provided context includes a code snippet that illustrates how an Event Receiver is implemented. A contract can listen for an event using a specific attribute.

```cpp
#include<eosio/eosio.hpp>
using namespace eosio;

CONTRACT receiver : public contract {
public:
  using contract::contract;

  [[eosio::on_notify("*::transfer")]]
  void watchtransfer(name from, ...
```

In this example:

*   The attribute `[[eosio::on_notify("*::transfer")]]` is used to set up the listener.
*   The argument `"*::transfer"` specifies that the contract should listen for the `transfer` action from **any** contract (indicated by the `*` wildcard).
*   The function `void watchtransfer(name from, ...)` is the Event Receiver function that will be executed whenever the specified `transfer` event occurs and this contract is notified.

Q: What is a smart contract in Vaulta/EOS?
A: Based on the provided context, a smart contract on Vaulta is a program that adds functionality to a Vaulta account and runs on the blockchain. It is analogous to a function and is primarily developed using C++.

Here are the key characteristics and components of a Vaulta smart contract as described in the documentation:

### Core Concept and Properties

*   **Function on the Blockchain:** A smart contract can be thought of as a function that executes on the blockchain.
*   **Deterministic:** It is a mandatory requirement for a smart contract to be deterministic. This means it must always produce the same output when given the same input, which is essential for all nodes on the network to agree on its results.
*   **Purpose:** Smart contracts are used to add functionality to an account. Their complexity can range from a simple application, like storing a string, to a fully-fledged RPG game operating entirely on the blockchain.

### Relationship with Accounts

*   **Deployment:** Smart contracts are deployed on top of Vaulta accounts. Each account can have only one smart contract deployed to it at any given time.
*   **Control and Updatability:** The owner of the account controls the smart contract and can update or replace it at will.
*   **Relinquishing Control:** An account owner can choose to relinquish control of a smart contract to make it immutable or semi-immutable. This can be done in a few ways:
    *   **Permanent (Burning Control):** Setting the account's permissions to `eosio.null@active`, a special account with no private key or owner.
    *   **Producer Controlled:** Transferring control to producer-controlled accounts (`eosio.prods`, `prod.major`, or `prod.minor`) so that network producers can approve future upgrades by consensus. This is an option for complex contracts that might contain bugs.
    *   **Important Caveat:** When relinquishing ownership, the `eosio.code` permission must be kept on the account's `active` permission, otherwise the contract may be "killed" as it will be unable to execute inline actions.

### Technical Anatomy and Structure

*   **Development Language:** The most common language for developing Vaulta smart contracts is C++. The context notes that the required C++ knowledge is minimal and that there are community efforts to support other languages like Rust, Python, Go, and AssemblyScript.
*   **Object-Oriented:** Contracts are defined in an object-oriented manner, similar to a `class` in C++. The `CONTRACT` keyword is used to declare a smart contract.
*   **Primary Elements:** Vaulta smart contracts are composed of two main elements:
    1.  **Actions:** These are the entry points to the contract, similar to callable functions.
    2.  **Tables:** This is the mechanism for storing data within the contract on the blockchain.
*   **Project Structure:** A contract can be written in a single monolithic `.cpp` file or split across multiple header (`.hpp`/`.h`) and source (`.cpp`) files, especially for larger projects.

In the provided "Write a Contract" guide, a simple example contract named `mycontract` is created. It defines a table (`mytable`) to hold records of type `StoredData` (containing an `id` and `text`) and an action (`save`) to add new records to that table.

Q: Explain the basic structure of a Vaulta smart contract file.
A: Based on the provided documentation, a Vaulta smart contract file follows a specific structure rooted in C++, utilizing special macros and attributes provided by the `eosio` library. Here is a breakdown of its basic anatomy, drawing from the code examples in the context.

### Core Components of a Vaulta Smart Contract File

The fundamental structure of a Vaulta smart contract is a C++ class that inherits from a base `contract` class. The code examples consistently show the following key components in order:

#### 1. Header Inclusion
The file must begin by including the primary Vaulta library header.

```cpp
#include <eosio/eosio.hpp>
```

*   **Purpose:** This header file provides access to all the necessary Vaulta-specific types, functions, and macros (like `CONTRACT`, `TABLE`, `ACTION`, etc.) required for smart contract development.

#### 2. Namespace Declaration
Immediately following the include is the namespace declaration.

```cpp
using namespace eosio;
```

*   **Purpose:** This is a standard C++ convention that allows you to use the types and functions from the `eosio` library directly (e.g., `name`, `contract`) without having to prefix them with `eosio::`.

#### 3. Contract Class Definition
The main body of the smart contract is defined within a class. Vaulta provides a special `CONTRACT` macro for this declaration.

```cpp
CONTRACT mycontract : public contract {
public:
    using contract::contract;

    // ... Tables and Actions go here ...
};
```
Let's break this down:
*   **`CONTRACT mycontract`**: This is a macro that declares a class named `mycontract`. This name is chosen by the developer.
*   **`: public contract`**: This indicates that your smart contract class (`mycontract`) inherits from the base `contract` class provided by the `eosio` library. This inheritance is essential for the contract to function correctly on the blockchain.
*   **`public:`**: This is a C++ access specifier, meaning all the members defined after it (actions, tables, etc.) are publicly accessible.
*   **`using contract::contract;`**: This line is crucial boilerplate. It brings the base class's constructor into the scope of your contract, ensuring that the contract is initialized properly.

#### 4. Data Storage Definition (Tables)
Data persistence on the blockchain is handled through tables. The `TABLE` macro is used to define the structure of the data you want to store.

```cpp
TABLE StoredData {
    uint64_t id;
    std::string text;
    // ... other fields
};
```

*   **Purpose:** The `TABLE` macro defines a C++ `struct`. Each instance of this struct represents a row in the contract's database table. The structure of these tables is described in the contract's ABI file, which is generated during compilation (Document 7).

#### 5. Logic Definition (Actions and Event Receivers)
The contract's functionality is exposed through actions and event receivers, which are essentially class methods with special attributes.

*   **Actions:** These are the primary entry points that users can call to interact with the smart contract. While a full `ACTION` macro example is not present in the snippets, the context states that actions are a primary element of a contract (Document 6).

*   **Event Receivers:** These are special functions that are not called directly by users but are triggered when another contract emits a notification. They are defined using the `[[eosio::on_notify]]` attribute.

An example of an event receiver from the context (Document 8):
```cpp
    [[eosio::on_notify("*::transfer")]]
    void watchtransfer(name from, name to, asset quantity, std::string memo) {
        // ... logic to handle the transfer event ...
    }
```
*   **`[[eosio::on_notify("...")]]`**: This is a C++ attribute that tells the Vaulta runtime to execute the `watchtransfer` function whenever any contract (`*`) executes a `transfer` action that notifies this contract.

In summary, every Vaulta smart contract file follows this foundational C++ class structure: it includes the `eosio.hpp` header, uses the `eosio` namespace, defines a class that inherits from `eosio::contract`, and then populates that class with `TABLE` structs for data and functions (like actions or event receivers) for logic.

Q: What are the access modifiers in C++ for Vaulta contracts?
A: Based on the provided documentation, the C++ access modifier explicitly mentioned and used for Vaulta smart contracts is `public`. The modifiers `private` and `protected` are not mentioned or demonstrated in the context.

Here is a detailed explanation of how the `public` access modifier is used:

### The `public` Access Specifier

The `public` keyword is used in two key places within the structure of a Vaulta smart contract:

1.  **Public Inheritance**: The contract class itself publicly inherits from the base `eosio::contract` class.
    ```cpp
    CONTRACT mycontract : public contract {
        // ...
    };
    ```
    This means that the public members of the base `contract` class are also public members of your `mycontract` class.

2.  **Public Class Members**: The members of the contract that need to be part of its external interface—such as actions, tables, and the constructor using-declaration—are placed under the `public:` access specifier.

    ```cpp
    CONTRACT mycontract : public contract {
    public:
        using contract::contract; // The constructor must be accessible

        // Actions and event receivers are defined here
        [[eosio::on_notify("*::transfer")]]
        void watchtransfer(name from, name to, asset quantity, std::string memo) {
            // ... logic
        }
    };
    ```
    *   The documentation explicitly states: "This is a C++ access specifier, meaning all the members defined after it (actions, tables, etc.) are publicly accessible."

### Role in the Contract's Interface

The concept of a public interface is central to how Vaulta contracts work. The context reinforces this by connecting the `public` members to the contract's Application Binary Interface (ABI).

*   **Actions**: Actions are described as "**publicly available functions**" that serve as the entry points for the contract.
*   **ABI File**: The ABI file, which is crucial for interacting with the contract, is defined as describing the "**publicly accessible functions (actions) and data structures (tables)**" of the contract.

This indicates that any function you want to be callable from outside the contract (i.e., an action) must be declared as `public`.

### `private` and `protected`

The provided context **does not contain any information** about the use of the `private` or `protected` access modifiers within Vaulta smart contracts. All examples and explanations focus exclusively on the `public` members that form the contract's external interface.
