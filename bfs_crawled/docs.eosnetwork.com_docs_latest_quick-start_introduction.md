# Introduction
Vaulta is one of the most performant blockchains in the world. It is capable of processing 10,000+ transactions per second, with minimal fees and near-instant confirmation times. 
Before you begin, you should have a basic understanding of blockchain technology and Vaulta. If you are new to blockchain, check out our [Core Concepts](https://docs.eosnetwork.com/docs/latest/core-concepts/blockchain-basics/decentralization) section which dives into the knowledge you need to get off on the right foot.
## Start coding immediately[​](https://docs.eosnetwork.com/docs/latest/quick-start/introduction/#start-coding-immediately "Direct link to Start coding immediately")
**We recommend trying things out in the[Web IDE](https://ide.vaulta.com/)** before you start developing locally.
But once you're ready to develop locally, you can use this CLI to create a new project with a frontend and contracts.
```
npm create vaulta@latest myproject  

```

Follow the prompts, and it will set up either a [Template Project](https://github.com/vaultafoundation/template-projects) or a barebones project with a simple contract, tests, and deployment scripts as well as a frontend of your choosing (SvelteKit, Next.js (react), or Nuxt (vue)).
Check out the next section to get started with your first smart contract.
